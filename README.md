# gcamxml
A guide to import custom XML settings into google camera ports

1. Get the latest gcam build:
https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-arnova8G2/

2. On your storage create a folder at this path:

    - GCam/Configs (Screenshot: https://github.com/H1XYZ/gcamxml/blob/master/!storage_path.jpg)
    - Download & put the XML files in that Config folder

3. Go back to the google camera app and import an XML

    - Double tap on the import area (Screenshot: https://github.com/H1XYZ/gcamxml/blob/master/!xml_toggle_import.jpg)
    - Select the XML of choice

Done.

Notes:
 - RAW SENSOR setting has a bug at the moment that causes crashes in selfie mode
 - RAW10 XMLs are good daily drivers with little to no crashes

A guide to import custom XML settings into google camera ports

1. Get the latest gcam build:

2. On your storage create a folder at this path:

    - GCam/Configs (Screenshot: https://github.com/H1XYZ/gcamxml/blob/master/!storage_path.jpg)
    - Put the XML files in that Config folder

3. Go back to the google camera app and import an XML

    - Double tap on the import area (Screenshot: https://github.com/H1XYZ/gcamxml/blob/master/!xml_toggle_import.jpg)
    - Select the XML of choice

Done.
